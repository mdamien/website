# Pure CSS slideshow

This is created as a proof of concept, so it's not fully functional cross browser.

## How it works

By adding radio boxes before each slide item we can target the active slide via the checked radio button.
The radio buttons function as bullets, each slide has a label which is connected to a radio button so we can 
use the arrow keys to target them
